If you sit in Office 365 webmail all day (any `*.outlook.com` URL afaik), this extension will watch for the calendar notification sounds that alert you to calendar events that pop up in that tab. Then, it will show webkit notifications on your desktop for those events *if* the tab in question isn't focused.

Currently relies on the mp3 request going out, and on certain DOM structure being in place (microsoft writes some horrid HTML). I would say it's not that great of a first extension, but maybe it'll provide insight to others.

### what the notifications looks like:
